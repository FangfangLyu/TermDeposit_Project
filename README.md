## Dataset Chosen
- Dataset: [Bank Marketing Response Predict](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kukuroo3/bank-marketing-response-predict/data?select=train.csv)
- **Training Data**: 12.9k rows
- **Testing Data**: 4.3k rows

## Project Objective
We aim to create a program that learns from the provided data to predict whether a bank account holder will be persuaded into investing in a term deposit. The model will use demographic information and details about previous campaigns to make predictions.

### Additional Services

1. **Term Deposit Interest Calculator (with User Interface)**:
    - **Input**: 
        - Initial investment
        - Interest rate
        - Term duration
        - Compound frequency
    - **UI**: 
        - A button to trigger the calculation.
        - A results section displaying the total amount at the end of the term and the interest earned.
    - **Ideal**: 
        - Display an interest breakdown for each year and a graphical representation of deposit growth over time.

2. **Customer Profile Matching** (Backup Additional Service):
    - Develop a system to match a customer's profile to those who are likely to agree to a term deposit.
    - The goal is to help the bank identify customers who would benefit from additional persuasive efforts to encourage them to invest in a term deposit.
